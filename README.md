# Elixir Code Dump

This repo is just a file dump of various elixir code I have written while learning the language.
Most are based on LeetCode problems that I have completed.

The code is messy and sometimes a bit specific to a particular problem, however, I am posting it for
my future reference and yours should you find it useful. I am mostly uploading code for problems
that I wasn't able to find idiomatic elixir solutions for anywhere on the first page of Google and 
had to tread my own path for.
